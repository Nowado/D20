# D20

Recognition of '20' on D20 dice.
Contatins Camera2imagesets.py for Raspberry to take photos and
Preprocessing_and_Augmentation.ipynb notebook for, well, preprocessing and augmentation.

ToDo:
- change preprocessing towards detection instead of recognition
- add recognition implementation
- make implementation->raspberry ready app pipe
